# Do Monads Matter?
### Functional Programming for People Who Hate Math

This repo is the source code for the Presentation [Functional Programming for People Who Hate Math](https://jlengstorf.github.io/presentations/functional-programming/slides/#/)

### tl;dr

Used properly, functional programming means cleaner code, easier maintenance, and simpler testing. But most of us will never use it. Why? Because **functional programming is usually explained with jargon**, complex math, and some nonsense about monads or whatever. And math is hard, so most of us run away screaming. **But here's the thing: functional programming doesn't actually require math.** This talk explains how we can get the benefits of functional programming today — with _no math required_.

### Longer Description

Functional programming is a game-changer. Used properly, it means:

- Cleaner code
- Easier maintenance
- Simpler testing
- More predictable software

**Despite the benefits, most developers never get started with functional programming.** But why?

The discussion about functional programming tends to spiral off into the mathematical stratosphere: **any benefits of functional programming are buried under thick layers of unfamiliar jargon and complicated mathematical concepts** like lambda calculus and monads and unary functions and composition and purity.

That's a lot of words. Math-sounding words. And **math sucks**, right?

As a result, most of us never learn how useful the concepts of functional programming can be. It sounds like this stuff is _way_ over our heads — and besides, **we just want to write great code**, not a doctoral thesis.

**But here's the thing: functional programming doesn't actually require a ton of complex math.** In fact, there's _no math required at all_ to start getting the benefits of functional programming in our projects.

In this talk, **we'll take a jargon-free look at functional programming concepts, and how we can apply them _today_ — no math required — to make our code more reliable, predictable, and maintainable.**
